# ELO RATING NBA

I devised an elo algorithm for NBA games of the 2018 season. In the frontend, we have a choice of just running some numbers for the 2018 season, or we can add our own games to the database. To make this better, I could make it so that the score has some influence on the results.

### The tech stack I used:

- PostgresQL
- React (typescript)
- NodeJs/Express

### Otherwise known as the PERN stack
